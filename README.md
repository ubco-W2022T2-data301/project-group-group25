# Group 25 - Insurance Charge Factors


## Topic/Interest Description

 The main goal of our analytics project is to analyze the provided dataset to gain insights into the factors that contribute to insurance charges. This analysis can help identify patterns and trends that can be useful for setting up insurance plans, marketing campaigns, and potentially exploring solutions for increasing affordability.

The topic of insurance charges is of interest because it is an important financial concern for many people, and understanding the factors that influence charges can help individuals make more informed decisions about their healthcare needs.

Some questions that could be explored with this dataset include:

- Which factors have the biggest impact on insurance charges?
- Are there differences in insurance charges based on region, gender, or smoking status?
- How do insurance charges change as individuals age or as their BMI increases?
- Are there any correlations between the number of children an individual has and their insurance charges?
Regarding building a user-facing dashboard, it is definitely possible to create a dashboard that visualizes the insights gained from this dataset. The dashboard could display important metrics, trends, and patterns related to insurance charges, and it could allow users to explore the data in more detail. Users could also interact with the dashboard to compare different demographic groups, filter the data by specific parameters, and view charts and graphs that illustrate the key findings.



## Dataset Description

Our dataset was retrieved from Kaggle.com. The original author is credited as Bob Wakefield at data.world.com. The dataset contains information about the patterns between insurance charges and various attributes individuals possess including age, gender, number of children, and BMI. This data can aid in predicting insurance charges, as well as identifying the optimal profile to minimize charges. The purpose of this dataset is likely academic in nature, as the original author stated that the dataset was compiled for the teaching of a data science class. However, the data contained may be of public interest as well, as many people will purchase life insurance policies at some point. The dataset was uploaded in August of 2020, but comments on data.world.com from the original author state that it is a ‘very old’ dataset. It was created by data scraping from various open source datasets over the years, and did not explicitly reference any websites.
