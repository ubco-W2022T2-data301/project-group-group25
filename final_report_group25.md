## Introduction
Welcome to our project on analyzing the factors affecting insurance pricing. The insurance industry is a vital component of the global economy, providing financial protection and risk management solutions to individuals and businesses alike. Understanding the factors that affect insurance pricing is important for insurers to make informed pricing decisions, for consumers to make informed purchase decisions, and for policymakers to regulate the industry effectively. By analyzing a  insurance pricing dataset, we targeted the impact of changes in law, technology, and consumer preferences on insurance pricing, ultimately contributing to a more transparent and efficient insurance market through our research and visualizations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Question 1 & Analysis (Prabh)

### Research question: 
    
##### - How have changes in law, technology, and consumer preferences affected the pricing of insurance policies over the past decade?

1. As we delved into the relationship between smoking status and insurance costs, we found that smokers generally have higher costs compared to non-smokers. We decided to create box plots to visualize the distribution of insurance costs for smokers and non-smokers. Our analysis revealed a clear distinction between the two groups, with smokers having significantly higher costs. This insight can be valuable to insurance companies when determining policy premiums for smokers, as they pose a higher financial risk.

The box plot above shows a clear distinction in insurance costs between smokers and non-smokers, and the t-test confirms that the difference is statistically significant. Insurance providers should take smoking status into account when determining policy premiums, as smokers pose a higher financial risk.

2. When exploring the impact of age on insurance costs, we observed a trend that suggests older individuals generally incur higher costs. We created a line chart to visualize this relationship more effectively. The chart demonstrated a positive correlation between age and insurance costs, signifying that as individuals grow older, their costs tend to increase. This finding can be used by insurance providers to offer age-based pricing strategies, ensuring a fair distribution of costs among policyholders.

The scatter plot above demonstrates a positive correlation between age and insurance costs, indicating that older individuals typically incur higher costs. Insurance providers can offer age-based pricing strategies to ensure a fair distribution of costs among policyholders.

3. In our exploration of the influence of region and number of children on insurance costs, we discovered variations in insurance costs across regions and different family sizes. We created a heatmap to visualize these relationships, which revealed that the southeast region generally has higher costs, especially for those with more children. This information could be useful for insurance companies in developing region-specific policies and targeting their marketing efforts more effectively.

The grouped bar chart reveals variations in insurance costs across regions and among families with different numbers of children. The multiple regression analysis shows that region and number of children are significant predictors of insurance costs. Insurance providers can use this information to develop region-specific policies and target their marketing efforts more effectively.

In my analysis of the various factors affecting insurance charges. I first started off our analysis by looking at the impact of smoking status on insurance costs. I found a significant difference in expenses between smokers and non-smokers, with smokers facing higher costs. This outcome implies that insurance providers should take smoking status into account when setting policy premiums.

Following that, I explored the connection between age and insurance costs. Our scatter plot displayed a positive correlation, signifying that older individuals generally incur higher costs. This understanding can assist insurance companies in developing age-based pricing strategies to ensure a fair allocation of costs among policyholders.

Finally, I examined the influence of region and the number of children on insurance costs. Our dataset revealed variations in costs across different regions and for families with varying numbers of children. Multiple regression analysis validated the importance of these factors in forecasting higher insurance costs. This data can help insurance providers in creating region-specific policies and effectively targeting their marketing efforts.
