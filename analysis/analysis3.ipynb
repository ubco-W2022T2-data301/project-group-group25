I want to do this by analyzing this relationship in a general context, as well as combined with other variables like age and gender. I am interested in whether insurance charges based on children are similar in men and women, or if there are identifiable differences. I am also curious about how insurance charges differ between age groups, based on number of children.\n"

    "- Key variables will include number of children, age, gender, and insurance charges. Identifying these will allow me to clean the data effectively. \n",
    "2. Data cleaning\n",
    "- Remove any NaN values from the dataset.\n",
    "- Remove any irrelevant data or outliers. \n",
    "- Drop columns that are irrelevant to my analysis.\n",
    "    - Including BMI, smoker, and region \n",
    "3. Shaping data by adding new columns, calculations, etc.\n",
    "- Calculations may include:\n",
    "    - Percentage of male vs. female with 1 child, 2 children, 3 children, etc.\n",
    "    - Percentage of 10 year-age increments with 1 child, 2 children, 3 children, etc.\n",

    "    - Number of children by gender\n",
    "    - Number of children by age increments\n",
